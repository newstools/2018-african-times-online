African Times News Digital Edition | www.africantimesnews.co.za | @AfricanTimesSA An 18-year-old pupil briefly appeared in the Senwabarwana Magistrate Court on Thursday facing murder charge after he stabbed a fellow learner to death at Mabotha High School in Malebogo, Limpopo.
Police said two learners had allegedly engaged in a heated argument which led to the fatal stabbing with a sharp instrument in the classroom. Both learners were in Grade 9.
Duncan Karabo Seema was immediately taken to the local clinic where he was declared dead on arrival.
The suspect was denied bail and his case was postponed to 2 March 2018 for a formal bail application and further police investigations.
In a statement, spokesperson for SAPS in Limpopo Colonel Moatse Ngoepe said: “Members of the community especially parents and guardians are advised and encouraged to ensure that all children are going to school unarmed to prevent this type of incidents to happen.”
He further said: “The name of the suspect cannot be disclosed since the age 18 is the margin between the youth and an adult. He added that the magistrate will still determine if the suspect will appear before an open or in-camera (privately).”
Meanwhile, Acting Provincial Commissioner Major General Jan Scheepers has condemned acts of violence which are still prevalent in some of the schools in the province: “Schools are expected to be a safe and secured learning environment without any act of violence or criminality.”
