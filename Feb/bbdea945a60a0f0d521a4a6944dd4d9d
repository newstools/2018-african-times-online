RUSSEL MOLEFE African Times News Digital Edition | www.africantimesnews.co.za | @AfricanTimesSA THE role of mining houses in the economic upliftment of communities and how to improve poor audit outcomes were the main topics at the Limpopo Exco Lekgotla which started in Polokwane on Thursday 15 February 2018. Whether the mining industry were satisfactorily involved in the economic empowerment of neighbouring communities remain a bone of contention in the province. There are almost 32 mines in operation in the province with many neighbouring communities always staging protests. In his opening address, Premier Stan Mathabatha emphasised the need for the Lekgotla to come out of the meeting with a clearer understanding on what needed to be done to facilitate economic growth and development. “We need to redefine the role of mining houses in our communities in particular the role that the mining industry should play on the economic upliftment of our communities. We should leave this Lekgotla with a workable approach on how to improve our audit outcomes so that we continue to enhance public confidence in government. “A presentation from the AG [Auditor-General] will help us identify and arrest areas of wastage. Curbing wastage will help us to direct resources to important areas such as education, health and projects that stimulate economic growth,” Mathabatha said. The Lekgotla is to end on Friday 16 February 2018, when a programme of action is expected to be released.
