The ABSA Stadium in East London was a sea of black, green and gold as thousands of ANC supporters turned up for the ANC’s 106 anniversary celebration. ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa called on the ruling party to go back to its roots and emulate the leadership of previous “legends” who led the liberation movement with “humility”. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta was one of the African leaders invited to join in the celebrations. Pictures: Visual Buzz SA
