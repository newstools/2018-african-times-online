ISAAC RAMOTHWALA Members of the South African Police Service Search and Rescue Unit on Wednesday morning succeeded in retrieving the body of a heavy duty truck driver from the wreckage at Chuenespoort in Limpopo.
The accident is believed to have been caused by heavy and continuous rains in the large parts of the province which resulted in the swelling of some rivers.
Police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo explained: “The driver of a heavy duty truck used to transport vehicles, lost control of the vehicle as he and three passengers were driving along the R37 road at Chuenespoort. The truck partially plunged into a fast-flowing river.
Members of the SAPS Search and Rescue Unit were called to the scene at approximately 22:00 and together with members of Polokwane EMS, the Fire Brigades of Polokwane and Lebowakgomo worked tirelessly into the early hours of Wednesday morning to free the body of the deceased driver from the wreckage as well as assisting in transporting the three injured passengers to hospital.
“The members had to operate in extremely dangerous conditions in the dark in the extreme weather conditions and had to cope with a fast flowing river.”
The identities of the deceased and the injured will be released in due course.
Meanwhile, Provincial Commissioner Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba has cautioned members of the public across the province to be extremely cautious in the continuous cloudy, misty and rainy conditions and warned motorists to drive safely. He also warned community members in the rural areas not to cross fast flowing rivers or streams.
