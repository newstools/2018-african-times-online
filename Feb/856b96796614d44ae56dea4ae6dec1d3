ANCYL leader says this will promote gender equality. AKANI MANGENA WOMEN have been urged to unite and support one another ahead of Limpopo’s provincial conference. ANC youth league deputy chairperson More Mokobane said women must throw full support behind one another if they are to eradicate inequality, attacks levelled against female candidates and to advance gender equity struggle. Mokobane told African Times that the male domination and the purge of women of has left her with no choice but to hang her head in shame, especially with signs that her female counterparts are backing this practice. “We now have a situation where our female comrades are disclosing their political interests to lead in higher political positions but their female friends and colleagues in politics are making it impossible for them just to please male candidates. It can’t be that we always make each other uncomfortable but make men more comfortable at our own happiness and emancipation,” Mokobane said. In reference to the recent attacks on female candidates who are eyeing positions in Limpopo’s top five, Mokobane called on women to ‘walk tall’ in the build-up to the conference if they are to see the leadership of generational mix and women occupying top positions. She said that she remains adamant that Limpopo is gifted with females who are ‘beacons of hope’ such as Polokwane executive mayor Thembi Nkadimeng, Limpopo ANC deputy secretary Makoma Makhurupetje, SACP Limpopo treasurer Dr Phophi Ramathuba and MEC for Sports, Arts and Culture Onicca Moloi who is gunning for the position currently held by Makhurupetje. “If they put all the squabbles behind them and unite, they are going to conquer every stumbling block politically and otherwise,” she said.
