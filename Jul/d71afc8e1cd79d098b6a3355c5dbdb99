MASHUDU SADIKE LIMPOPO- The African National Congress (ANC) has paid tribute and homage to Limpopo MEC for Agriculture Joyce Mashamba after her passing on Wednesday 20 June 2018 following a long illness. The ANC released a statement to the media expressing ‘deep sadness at the passing of Comrade Joyce Mashamba’. “The African National Congress extends its deepest condolences to her husband, ANC stalwart Cde George and her family, all her comrades and friends,” the statement added. MEC Mashamba led various portfolios in provincial government including being MEC for Education, Safety, Security and Liaison, as well as Sport, Arts and Culture and Social Development. She was also a Deputy Speaker in the Limpopo Legislature. Limpopo Premier Stan Mathabatha also relayed his regret to Mashamba death, hailing her as one of the most senior politicians in the province who “executed her responsibilities with diligence”. “On behalf of my family and I, the Executive Council and the people of Limpopo I send my deepest condolences to Cde Geoge Mashamba, the children and the family. Mashamba passed-on a few days ahead of the ANC and the alliance convening a Provincial elective conference. “Though unwell in the past few years, she continued to work until her last days. She passes away in the line of duty, we will continue to miss her counsel, wisdom in both government and society. “This happened when the people of the province are yearning for her leadership.” Mathabatha said. There will be a special seating by the Limpopo Legislature tomorrow in her honour and Mashamba will be laid to rest at a Provincial official funeral on Saturday at Madavula Stadium.
