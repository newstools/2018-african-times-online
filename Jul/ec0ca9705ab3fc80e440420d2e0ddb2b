THE academic exploits of some South African students backed by a leading global provider of fleet and mobile asset management solutions have been celebrated. The top ten achievers of the initiative by MiX Telematics were celebrated at the company’s offices in Midrand. They attained outstanding results, with the highest average achieved from one of the pupils was an impressive 90 percent, with four pupils achieving 80 percent to 89 percent and five pupils achieving an average of 75 percent to 79 percent respectively. The MiX Telematics Enterprise BEE Trust subsidises the education of these top achievers, from the Employee Education Fund. It was founded in 2013 and provides educational assistance to qualifying MiX employees who cannot afford quality education for their children. The fund makes provision for tuition fees, stationery, transport, school uniforms and, in certain instances, boarding fees. Unlike most bursaries or educational assistance programs, this fund not only focuses on high school students, but is specifically aimed at assisting students from as early as possible in their school careers. Bathandwa Kwababa, chairperson of the Trust, said investing in staff and their children was core to the company culture. “Through the Trust, we are able to not only offer tuition funding but also provide careful educational support, in order to enable these students to be the best that they can be,” Kwababa said. Kwababa said the end goal was to see the MiX Employee Education Fund being utilised by as many staff members as possible. The executive said the Trust had indicated that despite the fund’s accomplishments, support from across the company was always required. “The fund has created conditions under which only the best performing learners can emerge – which has only attracted more applicants, keen to prove that they have what it takes.”
