NJABULO BUTHELEZI ETHEKWINI Municipality has awarded Altech Netstar a three-year contract for the supply, integration and maintenance of a vehicle tracking technology solution for its vehicles, numbering 7 000. The deal, which will involve technology being deployed across the entire fleet, enables the municipality to track, monitor, communicate and respond in real-time. Netstar is a subsidiary of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange-listed Altron. Pierre Bruwer, Netstar Managing Director, said their technology solutions would be used to assist the eThekwini Municipality in providing a seamless transport service to the citizens. This includes the provision and maintenance of tracking and transport management. “Partnering with our customers to empower them is part of the Altron fabric, particularly with regard to skills development and service delivery,” Bruwer added. Bruwer said Netstar had been a leader in the safety and security industry in South Africa hence was proud to have been selected by the eThekwini Municipality to provide a critical service. “Government is a key customer for us, as we continue our journey to provide citizens with innovative solutions that matter.” Meanwhile Netstar has committed to ensuring skills development and female empowerment. Netstar runs an 18-month technician apprenticeship programme which entails training eThekwini’s female employees as technicians within the Fleet Systems and Monitoring division. They have studied Electrical Engineering with support from the City, Netstar and on-site mentors. Suben Govender, Senior Manager at the Municipality’s City Fleet, said the unit was passionate about ensuring employment equity and the transfer of skills. “In our previous model we had appointed a service provider to handle the maintenance of our tracking systems but there was little to no skills transfer. It is imperative that the youth are empowered so that they become employable,” Govender said.
