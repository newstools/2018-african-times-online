THE upcoming eKasi Tech Fest in Soweto will enhance the emergence of gaming, animation and virtual reality as key future employers of township youth in South Africa. Set for October18-20, it will provide game developers with the opportunity to present their independently-developed content to the event organisers and information and communication technologies (ICT) sector luminaries to stand a chance to be incubated by Maxum Digital. Located at the Digital Innovation Zone in Johannesburg’s Tshimologong Precinct, Maxum Digital provides business development support to digital start-ups in gaming, animation and virtual reality. It supports unemployed graduates and township youth in collaboration with The Innovation Hub and Wits University. “Our young people are proving every day that they have the creativity and the willingness to overcome the odds stacked against them to use ICT technologies to build that better life,” said Mpho Tladi, spokesperson for the eKasi Tech Fest organisers. The much anticipated technology event will be held at the Dlamini Multipurpose Centre. Over three days, the festival will host a number of platforms including the Gauteng Gaming Community Cup, interactive panel discussions and exhibitions. In addition, eKasi Tech Fest is calling on gamers across the province to take part in the Gauteng Gaming Community Cup Tournament (GGCT). The GGCT final will be held on October 20. Knock-out stages will take place in different regions within province, starting in August. Founded by the Soweto-based i-Village Foundation, the eKasi Tech Fest has the key objective of bridging the digital divide to enable township communities to participate in the Fourth Industrial Revolution to ensure sustainable development. Entrepreneurs, students, gamers and the general public are invited attend the event that will showcase the latest technology developments, at no cost.
