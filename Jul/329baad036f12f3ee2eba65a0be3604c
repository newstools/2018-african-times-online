SOME 22 businesswomen from 13 African countries are in the United States to connect with their American counterparts and accelerate the growth of their businesses. They are travelling under the aegis of the African Women’s Entrepreneurship Program (AWEP), which runs until July 27. AWEP is a special initiative of the International Visitor Leadership Programme, now in its ninth year of elevating women entrepreneurs who are transforming their societies through business. This year’s cohort represents Cameroon, Central African Republic, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Liberia, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Togo and Zimbabwe. The businesswomen in this year’s AWEP join a network that has created thousands of jobs and over 20 women’s business associations in sub-Saharan Africa. The initiative promotes business growth and increases trade both regionally and with US markets through the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). The women will visit American private companies, business incubators, financial institutions, schools, and mentorship institutions. According to the US Department of State, the women would return home to continue their work as women advocates with AWEP chapters in their countries.
