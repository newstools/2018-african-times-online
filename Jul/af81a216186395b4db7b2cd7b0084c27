PREMIERSHIP defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns are leaving no stone unturned in the preseason matches as they beat Kaizer Chiefs 2-0 in the inaugural Shell Helix Ultra Cup played at FNB Stadium on Saturday. Smarting from their narrow 0-1 defeat at the hands of little known Togolese side AS Togo-Port last week, Sundowns approached the match with much purpose as they played their usual flawless football. Goals by Jeremy Brockie and Themba Zwane were enough to see Sundowns clinch their preseason trophy. Earlier, Brockie had given Sundowns a lead courtesy of a rebound from an Anthony Laffor ball that crashed against the upright post in the early stages of second half. Zwane killed off the contest in 90 minutes of regulation time to Chiefs shelf shocked. However, Chiefs pulled one back in injury time through Bernard Parker’s header from a corner kick. Khama Billiart was voted man of the match by soccer fans. – CAJ News
