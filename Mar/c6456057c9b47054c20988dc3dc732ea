General Nneke Ledwaba has condemned the killing of three people in the Saselamani in the most strongest possible terms. The condemnation follows the massive manhunt launched by the Saselamani Police outside Malamulele where the deceased were brutally murdered by unknown suspects today on Monday. It is alleged that a man and woman in their thirties were kidnapped by unknown suspects while driving a Toyota Tazz near Makonde village outside Thohoyandou. Afterwards, the murderers loaded them inside the boot of their vehicle and drove away to a secluded area near Matiyani village along the Punda Malia road. They were fatally shot, set alight inside the vehicle and burnt beyond recognition. The body of an unknown man with multiple gunshot wounds was also discovered some meters away from the scene. The motive behind the incident is still unknown but police investigations are continuing. Ledwaba said: “Those perpetrators who still engaged on committing these barbaric acts are cautioned to stop this senseless killings of our people. There is no justifiable reason for anyone to take an innocent life in this horrific manner. We are going to hunt these suspects around the clock until they are brought to justice,” said Ledwaba.
