Hundreds of people descended on Cape Town to celebrate the centenary of the birth of struggle icon and former president Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. The ANC has declared this year as “the year of Nelson Mandela”. Mandela, who spent 27 years jailed by the apartheid government, would have been 100 years. He died at the age of 95. The event in Cape Town took place at the Grand Parade. It also marked 28 years since Mandela was released from decades in prison and made his first public address from the City Hall balcony overlooking the Grand Parade. Pictures: Visual Buzz SA
