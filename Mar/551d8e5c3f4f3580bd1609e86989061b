Former Prime Minister, Morgan Tsvangirai. DANAI MWARUMBA FORMER Zimbabwe first lady Grace Mugabe is facing arrest for her dubious Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree acquired in 2014. The Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) is said to be considering the move following the arrest of officials from the University of Zimbabwe (UZ) that were involved in the awarding of the PhD in Sociology. UZ vice-chancellor, Professor Levi Nyagura, was arrested last week while the anti-graft agency is investigating former Sociology Department chairman, Professor Claude Mararike, who is suspected to have facilitated and presided over the awarding of the contentious qualification. “It is our conviction that the real culprit here is Grace Mugabe,” said Kurauone Chihwayi, spokesperson of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change. “We believe she (Grace) initiated the whole embarrassing academic scandal. In our view Grace is accused number one.” Grace is suspected to have manipulated her husband, former state president Robert Mugabe, who was the chancellor of the country’s all universities. Pressure groups, human rights and opposition parties have been piling relentless pressure on President Emmerson Mnangagwa to rid the country of corruption. There are calls for him to appoint a new capable corruption watchdog with the current one accused of being partisan along the factionalism in Zimbabwean politics. The arrest would signal the spectacular fall of the former first lady, who before the then President Mugabe was pressured by the military to resign, had emerged the leading contender to succeed her husband. – CAJ News Former Zimbabwe first lady Grace Mugabe.
