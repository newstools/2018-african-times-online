The Traffic Officer arrested and charged with attempted murder after he allegedly opened fire on three teenage girls walking along the street, wounding one of them in Westenburg, outside Polokwane, in Limpopo.
The suspect will appear at the Polokwane magistrate court on Friday.
Spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe confirmed that the girl, who can’t be named due to her being a minor, is back home recovering from the incident.
It is alleged that the three minor girls aged between 13, 15 and 17 were walking along the street when the suspect insulted them.
“An exchange of words ensued between the man and the youngsters until he chased them with his motor vehicle and the suspect apparently fired several shot in the direction of the children injuring the 17 year old girl in the process,” said Ngoepe.
Ngoepe says after the Police and the Medical Emergency services were summoned and immediately responded leading to the apprehension of the suspect and the confiscation of his private firearm. The victim was rushed to the local hospital where she was treated and is recuperating at home.
According to Ngoepe, further Police investigations were still being conducted to establish the circumstances of the shooting and warned gun owners to be more responsible.
“Legal gun owners are reminded to always comply with the provisions of the firearm Controls Act. Any contravention of this Act may result in the owner being declared unfit to possess a firearm in addition to the criminal charges that will be pressed against the individual,” he said.
