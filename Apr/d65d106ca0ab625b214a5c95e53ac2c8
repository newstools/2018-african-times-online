AKANI CHAUKE African Times News Digital Edition | www.africantimesnews.co.za | @AfricanTimesSA THE Gauteng InvestSA One Stop Shop (OSS) has been launched to provide professional service to investors, reduce regulatory inefficiencies and reduce red tape for entrepreneurs looking to invest in the province.
The Minister of Trade and Industry, Dr Rob Davies, and Gauteng Premier, David Makhura launched the facility in Sandton.
Davies said InvestSA Gauteng OSS is part of a priority by government to improve South Africa’s service delivery to all investors.
“Boosting investor confidence is critical to positioning South Africa as a premium destination for foreign direct investment. InvestSA is our investment brand identity that we will develop domestically and internationally,” Davies said.
Since the launch of the National One Stop Shop in 2017, it has hosted 624 investor consultations.
As per these interactions, 21 regulatory issues were escalated to the relevant departments and subsequently unblocked.
Makhura said Gauteng is home to multinationals that have invested in South Africa and a gateway for such companies to invest in the rest of Africa.
He expressed his satisfaction with national government in terms of the partnership and value-added product offerings that the OSS will offer investors.
“The task of countries that want to be competitive investment destinations is to make it easy for business to set up shop and remove all hindrances that may drive investors away. We are responding to this with the launch of InvestSA Gauteng,” said Makhura.
Greg Hand, United Kingdom Minister of State for Trade Policy, South African ministers, diplomats, investors and senior government officials attended the launch of the InvestSA Gauteng launch. – CAJ News
