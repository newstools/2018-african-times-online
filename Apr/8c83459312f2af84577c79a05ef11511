IF YOU reminisce about days gone by, when a train trip provided you with more than a simple perfunctory service, and long for a throwback to the days of steam trains, take a trip on the fabulous Tshwane Explorer. Covering a distance of 60km in and around Pretoria, the Tshwane Explorer steam train trip is the perfect way to spend a leisurely afternoon. If you have children, this is a great chance to introduce them to the magic of steam trains. The Tshwane Explorer, which departs from the private Hermanstad Station, alongside Michaelson Street in Hermanstad, Pretoria, snakes through a number of suburbs on its way to the nearby town of Cullinan, including Gezina, Villieria, Queenswood, Waltloo, Silverton, Deneboom and Mamelodi. Along the way you will likely catch sight of various game, kept by farmers in the area, including bontebok and ostriches. The game viewing gets a lot more exciting when passing the Somabula Nature Reserve, where animals such as rhino, antelope, kudu, impala and giraffe roam. After the train pulls into Cullinan Station, you are allowed to disembark and take photos of the train and then explore the beauty and tranquillity of this small town. Enjoy lunch at one of the local restaurants or find a spot to enjoy the picnic lunch you packed. The train departs at a scheduled time, so it’s up to you to make sure you arrive back at the station with enough time to spare – about 15 minutes before the scheduled departure time.- www.southafrica. net Did You Know?
