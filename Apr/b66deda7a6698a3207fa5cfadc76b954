On a sweltering hot day at Mokwakwaila Stadium outside Tzaneen in Limpopo, the Balobedu gathered to finally celebrate the restoration of their queenship status. In song and dance, they welcomed queen elect Masalanabo Modjadji VII (13), the first officially recognised queen after the end of apartheid in 1994. The Modjadji queenship is revered in history through its rain making powers. Pictures: Lebogang Makwela/Visual Buzz SA
