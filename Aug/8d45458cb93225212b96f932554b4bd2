EDUCATING children in a way that ensures their space in the future working environment is critical to enabling the growth and stability of South Africa, a technology executive has said. The sentiments by Justin Hume come on the back of Samsung’s Smart Classroom and Digital Village initiatives that are hailed for making a difference in the lives of children who would not normally have access to learning about and through technology. “Technology is a powerful tool for social change, especially when it comes to education,” said Hume, the Chief Marketing Office for Samsung South Africa. “The desired end-result is to introduce technology and make e-learning accessible to learners from previously disadvantaged communities,” added Hume. The Smart Classroom, such as the one at Michael Zulu Primary School in Tsakane, Brakpan in the east of Johannesburg, is a fully integrated, real-time digital classroom that creates a simple, interactive and engaging environment for students and teachers. Educators and students share various, dynamic lesson materials and apply innovative technology to the learning experience through the screen sharing and S-Pen digital handwriting features. Samsung’s goal, as the company states, is for the Smart Classroom experience to enhance interactive learning, collaborative teaching with shared best practices and support the development of new teaching methods based on the students’ needs. The other educational initiative, Digital Villages – such as the Lesego Digital Village at Ratlou in North West – incorporates clinics and administration areas that are solar powered, in areas that have no access to electricity or technology. Digital Villages provide comprehensive support to improve health standards, bolster education opportunities and increase the potential for people to lead economically independent lives.
