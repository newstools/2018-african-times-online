MORE than 700 families were left homeless after eviction by the red ants in Aquaville informal settlement outside Groblersdal. According to the Elias Motsoaledi Local Municipality, the property belongs to Sekhukhune TVET College which sought a court order to have the people removed from the land. Community leader Kgolole Masemola lashed out at the municipality and accused it of not caring about the people after it failed to intervene in the matter. He said the municipality only recognized Aquaville residents during elections. “This is a serious problem for the residents of Aquaville. The local municipality comes to us when they need votes but today they claim no knowledge of our existence. We feel betrayed. They must give us our votes back because to them we do not exist,” he said. Masemola said people lost their belongings as the red-ants carried out the evictions and that many were left homeless. “We do not know where people are going to sleep. They don’t have food and others lost everything during the eviction process,” said Masemola. He said they needed the municipality to intervene in the saga and provide the affected families with an alternative place to stay. “We need the local and the district municipality to tell us where we should go. They know about us because we have been leaving here for more the 24 years,” concluded Masemola. Lopi Ranala, Economic Freedom Fighters Councillor, said the situation was bad in that it involved children, women and the disabled. “We are going to engage the local municipality to see how they can help these people,” said Ranala. Abbickey Kgolane, Sekhukhune TVET College Marketing Officer, confirmed the land belongs to the college. Kgolane said the college acquired the property about three years ago.
