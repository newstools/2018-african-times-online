THE mining industry is tipped to contribute significantly to the Kenyan Government’s Big Four Agenda. Manufacturing, universal healthcare, affordable housing and food security are the pillars of the economic plan. The mineral industry provides key raw materials for at least three of these pillars. The third edition of the Kenya Mining Forum, set for the capital Nairobi in November, will focus strongly on how the industry can contribute to the government’s blueprint. “Kenya remains an exciting new mining destination on the continent,” said Moses Njiru Njeru, Chief Executive Officer of the Kenya Chamber of Mines. The chamber will host the forum. “The nation’s upbeat tempo and progressive mindset are ready to embrace technology and innovations to leapfrog the entire mining value chain towards becoming a modern mining player,” Njeru said. He said, for example, an extensive airborne survey of Kenya was underway to identify all the mineral opportunities. “Numerous industrial minerals are used as raw materials in manufacturing. Precious metals and gemstones are also used in the manufacturing of jewellery for the local and export markets,” Njeru said. The Kenya Mining Forum is organised in collaboration with Spintelligent Ltd, the internationally recognised events management company. High-level government and industry experts have been confirmed to speak. There is significant industry support for the event.
