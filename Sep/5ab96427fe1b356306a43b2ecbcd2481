MASHUDU SADIKE LIMPOPO police have launched a manhunt for suspects involved in the kidnapping and murder of a man believed to be the father of the second wife of murder accused Rameez Patel in Polokwane. It has emerged that the deceased, Yunus Mayet along with his family was held at gunpoint by the suspects at their residence in Sterpark after returning home from the mall on Saturday afternoon. According to Police, the suspects allegedly fired shots randomly in the house before forcing the victim into what is believed to have been a black Volkswagen Golf GTI. They left the city shot him execution style. The body was reportedly found along Silicon Road next to the airport, with several bullet wounds. Police Spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said they were investigating a case of kidnapping and murder. “The suspects fired shots randomly in the house and took cell phones, watches and an unknown amount of cash. They later took Mr Yunus Mayet and drove away with him until at about 00:00 when he was found lying dead along the Silicon Road next to the airport,” Ngoepe said. Patel has been on trial for the double murder of his 28-year-old wife, Fatima Patel in 2015 and that of his 51-year-old mother, Mahejeen Patel, who died in 2017. For the past four years, the influential Patel family have been entangled in a series of woes since Patel’s alleged murders. The murder of the family patriarch, Feroz Patel in a hail of bullets in 2016 remains unsolved. The deaths have compounded the fear and terror that have forced other family members to flee South Africa. The latest to leave was Rameez’s younger brother, 24-year-old Razeen Patel, who was shot four hours before he was to testify against his brother. Razeen left South Africa soon after being discharged from the hospital.
