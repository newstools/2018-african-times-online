DQ&A, the digital marketing and technology specialist, has launched a training academy to help both companies and agencies looking to build and upskill their digital marketing teams. Johan Walters, Managing Consultant at DQ&A, said the decision to launch the training academy comes as more companies were looking to bolster their internal competencies. “We are also able to help agencies and publishers who are looking to upskill their teams and which have clients who require the full power of the Google Marketing Platform and Google Ad Manager,” explained Walters. As part of the IncuBeta Group, DQ&A and its sister company, NMPi, have access to over 400 digital marketing experts in 13 markets across five continents. Jonathan Gluckman, CEO of NMPi Asia Pacific and Africa, said with more than 1 000 customers and campaigns running in more than 100 countries and in 55 languages, their team had a deep understanding of how to successfully deliver in some of the most complex environments. Gluckman said they had distilled that insight to create a curriculum which is locally relevant but carries all the experience of 15 years of global delivery. “Learners will graduate with far more than just certification. They will also have the benefit of being able to tap into our extensive real-world experience,” Gluckman said.
